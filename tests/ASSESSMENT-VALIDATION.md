## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Response is just intention, no data"

**Example:** Agent responds "I'll check the portfolio health..." instead of actual data

**Cause:** Tool calling not working (OpenRouter/OpenAI configuration issue)

**Solution:**
- Verify using OpenAI directly (not OpenRouter)
- Check `lib/agent/agent.ts` uses `ChatOpenAI` without custom baseURL
- Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is valid

---

### Issue 2: "Rate limit exceeded"

**Cause:** Too many API calls in short time

**Solution:**
- Wait 60 seconds
- Upgrade OpenAI plan
- Test runs with 1.5s delay between questions

---

### Issue 3: "Missing expected keywords"

**Cause:** Tool returned data but not in expected format

**Solution:**
- Review specific question/answer
- May need to adjust expected keywords in test
- Check if tool is returning correct data structure

---

### Issue 4: "Tool not found"

**Cause:** Tool not registered in agent

**Solution:**
- Check `lib/agent/tools.ts` exports `allTools` array
- Verify all 10 tools are in the array
- Restart server after code changes

---
