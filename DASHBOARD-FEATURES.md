2. ✅ **Gross NPA Rate** - Industry-standard metric with threshold badges
3. ✅ **Net NPA Rate** - Post-provision NPA calculation
4. ✅ **Average Risk Score** - Portfolio risk assessment
5. ✅ **Provision Coverage Ratio** - PCR metric for NPA provisioning

#### **Delinquency Tracking**
6. ✅ **Portfolio at Risk (PAR)** - Loans with DPD > 0
7. ✅ **PAR 30+ Rate** - Loans overdue by 30+ days
8. ✅ **PAR 60+ Rate** - Loans overdue by 60+ days
9. ✅ **PAR 90+ Rate** - Critical delinquency metric

#### **Collections & Recovery**
10. ✅ **Collection Efficiency** - On-time payment rate
11. ✅ **Cure Rate** - Loans returning to current status

### 2. **Advanced Visualizations (Beyond Bar/Line Charts)**

#### **A. Treemap Chart - Sector Exposure** 🌟 **NEW**
- **Purpose**: Visual hierarchy of portfolio by sector
- **Size**: Exposure amount
- **Color**: Risk level (Green=Low, Amber=Medium, Red=High)
- **Interactivity**: Click to drill down to sector details
- **Library**: Nivo Treemap
- **Why Impressive**: Uncommon in traditional BI, shows concentration at a glance

#### **B. Sankey Diagram - Delinquency Flow** 🌟 **NEW**
- **Purpose**: Visualize loan movement between DPD buckets
- **Flow**: Current → 1-30 DPD → 30-60 DPD → 60-90 DPD → 90+ DPD → NPA
- **Shows**: Cure rates, progression rates, bucket transitions
- **Library**: Nivo Sankey
- **Why Impressive**: Rarely seen in credit risk dashboards, shows "roll rates" visually

#### **C. Heatmap - Risk Concentration Matrix** 🌟 **NEW**
- **Purpose**: Identify high-risk sector-geography combinations
- **Axes**: Sector (Y) × Geography (X)
- **Color**: Risk intensity (darker = higher risk)
- **Interactivity**: Click cell to see loans in that segment
- **Library**: Nivo Heatmap
- **Why Impressive**: Two-dimensional risk analysis, instant hotspot identification

#### **D. Radar Chart - Portfolio Health Scorecard** 🌟 **NEW**
- **Purpose**: Multi-dimensional portfolio assessment
- **Dimensions**: 8 metrics (Portfolio Quality, Collection Efficiency, Risk Management, etc.)
- **Comparison**: Current vs Industry Benchmark
- **Library**: Nivo Radar
- **Why Impressive**: Executive-friendly, holistic view of portfolio health

#### **E. Waterfall Chart - NPA Movement** 🌟 **NEW**
- **Purpose**: Show components of NPA change
- **Components**: Opening NPA + New NPAs + Deterioration - Recoveries - Write-offs - Upgrades = Closing NPA
- **Library**: Recharts Custom Implementation
- **Why Impressive**: Finance industry standard, shows change attribution

#### **F. Roll Rate Table - Transition Matrix** 🌟 **NEW**
- **Purpose**: Delinquency bucket transition probabilities
- **Shows**: Cure rates, progression rates, stable rates
- **Format**: Professional table with color-coded cells
- **Metrics**: % moving from each bucket to every other bucket
- **Why Impressive**: Core credit risk analytics, rarely automated

- 📊 **Loan Status Toggles** (Active/Closed/NPA/Restructured)

**Features:**
- **Active Filter Count Badge**: Shows number of applied filters
- **Filter Chips**: Visual representation of active filters with X to remove
- **Reset All Button**: One-click filter reset
- **Collapsible Panel**: Minimize to save space
- **State Management**: Zustand for global filter state
- **Auto-Refresh**: All visualizations update on filter change

---

### 4. **Drill-Down System** 🎯

**When User Clicks:**
- **Treemap Sector**: Opens modal with filtered loans in that sector
- **Heatmap Cell**: Opens modal with loans in sector+geography combination

**Modal Shows:**
- **3 Key Metrics**: Exposure, Count, Risk Score/NPA Rate
- **Loan Table**: Top 20 loans with full details
  - Loan ID, Customer, Amount, Outstanding, Status, Risk Score, DPD
  - Color-coded badges for status and risk
- **Total Count**: "Showing 20 of X loans"
